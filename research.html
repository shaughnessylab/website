      </h2>
      <p>
        The Shaughnessy Lab investigates the <strong>physiological mechanisms</strong> that support epithelial transport processes, endocrine signaling pathways, and environmental adaptation, across diverse vertebrate systems and <strong>macroevolutionary timescales</strong>. Our work integrates molecular, cellular, and whole-organism approaches, with a particular emphasis on ion transport, hormonal signaling, and stress physiology. Research in the lab spans both fundamental and applied questions, and is organized around three complementary themes: <span class="bold underline">Comparative Physiology</span>, which examines the evolution and regulation of physiological systems across taxa; <span class="bold underline">Applied Physiology</span>, which addresses conservation or industry needs by contributing physiological insights; and <span class="bold underline">Translational Physiology</span>, which focuses on epithelial transport and CFTR function in the context of human disease.
      </p>

    </h2>

    <p>
      Our research in this theme is centered on processes of <strong>environmental physiology</strong> and the endocrine programs that regulate them. We integrate <em>in vivo</em>, <em>ex vivo</em>, and <em>in vitro</em> approaches and focus our attention primarily to processes of ionoregulation, stress, and thermal tolerance. Although the majority of our studies have <strong>centered on fishes</strong>, past and ongoing work also includes studies on crustaceans and amphibians. Given that we work heavily on basal lineages of fishes (i.e., hagfishes, lampreys, elasmobranchs, and non-teleosts), a major emphasis of this work that has emerged is in <strong>understanding how complexity in physiological processes evolved</strong> throughout the radiation of vertebrates, including how endocrine signaling systems or epithelial transport processes gained or lost function through genome evolutionary events. This research is deeply integrated in a broader community of comparative physiology and endocrinology, and we regularly present our work at meetings such as the International Congress on the Biology of Fish (ICBF), the North American Society for Comparative Endocrinology (NASCE), as well as other meetings less frequently.

      </h3>
      <p>
        This research focuses on how aquatic vertebrates regulate salt and water balance through epithelial ion transport. We investigate the function of <strong>ionocytes</strong> (i.e., specialized cells that mediate epithelial ion movements) in the gill and intestinal tract and the hormonal signals that modulate their presence and activity during developmental and environmental changes. Our investigations combine <strong>organismal experiments</strong> with <strong>molecular, histological, and electrophysiological analyses</strong> to examine ionoregulatory mechanisms. By combining molecular and functional approaches in both model and non-model fishes, we explore the <strong>diversity and plasticity of osmoregulatory physiology</strong> in vertebrates. These comparative studies aim to understand how varied ion transport strategies enable ecological transitions (e.g., movement between fresh and salt water) and evolved throughout the radiation of vertebrates.

      </h3>
      <p>
        This research investigates the functional evolution of neuroendocrine signaling pathways in early vertebrates. We focus primarily on the <strong>hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal/interrenal</strong> (HPA/HPI) axis, including the melanocortin (Acth/Msh) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (Crh) signaling systems. We examine how <strong>functional diversity of ligands and receptors</strong> in these systems emerged across the radiation of vertebrates. Our work combines manipulative physiological experiments (e.g., administration of hormones or receptor antagonists) with <em>in vitro</em> experimentation and molecular analyses (e.g., cloning, heterologous expression in mammalian systems, pharmacological characterization, and evolutionary genetics). Through these approaches, we explore the physiological role(s) of these neuroendocrine pathways in basal vertebrates, the <strong>evolution of receptor function</strong> (e.g., ligand-receptor specificity and cell signaling interactions), and the expansion, diversification, and specialization of endocrine gene families. Our comparative studies in basal fishes aim to further our understanding of how changes in receptor architecture and regulatory elements contributed to the <strong>emergence of endocrine complexity in vertebrates</strong>.

      Our applied physiology research leverages fundamental principles of comparative physiology to address real-world challenges in conservation, aquaculture, and fisheries management. We study how animals physiologically respond to <strong>environmental change and stress</strong>, and use this knowledge to inform practices that support the sustainability of natural and managed populations. This includes developing <strong>experimental tools and physiological biomarkers</strong> for assessing tolerance, performance, and resilience in native and invasive species. Our work often involves <strong>collaborations with agencies and stakeholders</strong> and seeks to produce insights that can be translated into <strong>actionable outcomes</strong> for biodiversity preservation, invasive species control, and habitat management.

      </h3>
      <p>
        This research focuses specifically on the stress component of environmental physiology, with particular emphasis on <strong>thermal stress</strong>, <strong>salinity stress</strong>, and the physiological effects of <strong>chronic stress</strong> from adverse environmental conditions. We study how endocrine systems, such as <strong>corticosteroid signaling</strong>, regulate or result from adaptive stress responses to ecological or environmental challenges. We also examine the role of hepatic metabolism as a downstream effector of corticosteroid action, particularly in mediating <strong>energy mobilization</strong> during acute and chronic stress. Our approach integrates organismal experiments (e.g., chronic stress paradigms, heat shock and CT<sub>max</sub> trials), endocrine profiling, and molecular and biochemical analyses (e.g., Hsp expression and metabolic enzyme activities). Through these efforts, we aim to understand how stress tolerance and endocrine function vary across taxa, populations, and environmental contexts.

        This research produces and applies physiological tools to understand or predict how aquatic vertebrates respond or adapt to changing or stressful environmental conditions, particularly in conservation and aquaculture contexts. We investigate how <strong>thermal, osmotic, and seasonal stressors</strong> affect the performance and survival of native, invasive, introduced, or cultured species. Projects in this area include the <strong>integration of physiological experiments with ecological modeling</strong> to evaluate environmental limits, identify management-relevant biomarkers, and characterize intraspecific variation in physiological responses environmental pressures. This work often involves collaboration with ecologists, aquaculturists, and conservation agencies (inlcuding the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation and the Great Lakes Fishery Commission) focused on population ecology, ecophysiology, species resilience,invasive species control, environmental adaptation, or sustainable agriculture.

      Our translational work focuses on <strong>epithelial ion transport and CFTR regulation</strong> in the context of <strong>cystic fibrosis</strong>. This research leverages <em>in vitro</em> <strong>airway epithelial models and electrophysiological techniques</strong> to investigate the molecular mechanisms of CFTR function and pharmacological modulation. While our lab does not directly aim to develop therapies, our goal is to contribute to the foundational understanding of epithelial signaling and CFTR function in ways that may <strong>inform therapeutic innovation</strong>. This work connects us with the broader cystic fibrosis research community, particularly through collaborations and scientific exchange supported by the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) and the Oklahoma Center for Respiratory and Infectious Diseases (OCRID). We also engage with research presented at the North American Cystic Fibrosis Conference (NACFC) and related professional meetings.
