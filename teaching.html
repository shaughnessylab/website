      <!-- =================== TEACHING OVERVIEW =================== -->

      <h2 class="section-title"><span class="secondary">Teaching</span><span class="highlight">Overview</span></h2>
      <p>
        <span class="none">I teach upper-level physiology through a molecular and cellular lens</span>, and <span class="none">I mentor undergraduate and graduate students in integrative physiological research</span>. My teaching emphasizes mutual respect and clarity, and utilizes inclusive and active learning instructional approaches. <span class="bold">In both the classroom and the lab, my goal is to help my students develop confidence, critical thought, and durable strategies for life-long learning and scientific inquiry</span>.
      </p>

      <!-- =================== TEACHING PHILOSOPHY =================== -->

      <h2 class="section-title"><span class="secondary">Teaching</span><span class="highlight">Philosophy</span></h2>
      <p>
        I am deeply committed to my role as an educator and mentor. In this role, I try to establish a connection with my students by  mutual respect and shared interest in our common success. I view myself as a facilitator of my students' learning and growth, not just as a disseminator of information. Importantly, I recognize that my students come from diverse backgrounds with different learning needs and preferences. FOr this reason, I try to build a classroom environments that is inclusive, equitable, and engaging for all my students.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want my students to be exposed to the complexities of biological concepts and processes and to succeed by developing successful learning strategies to understand complex material. To do this, I aim to clearly communicate course expectations, provide predictable course structure, and offer low-stakes opportunities for students to practice skills before assessments. I design my courses to challenge students in a supportive environment such that they are able to take ownership of their learning process. <strong>I want to help my students to develop independence and curiosity</strong>, and I aim to guide them toward a deeper understanding of both content and process.
      </p>

      <!-- =================== PEDAGOGY =================== -->

      <h4 class="teaching-label">Pedagogy</h4>
      <p>
        In my courses, I utilize active learning instructional approaches, opportunities for assignment revision and corrections, and structured reflection activities to engage students with the process of learning. I aim to support student motivation by offering assignment choices, accessible review opportunities, and opportunities to <strong>practice without penalty</strong>. I believe this creates space for students to develop confidence and <strong>build mastery at their own pace</strong>.
      </p>

      <!-- =================== EDUCATION SCIENCE INTERESTS =================== -->

      <h4 class="teaching-label">Interests in Education Science</h4>
      <p>
        I enjoy studying and practicing insights gleaned from education science, particularly with respect to the teaching of college-level physiology. I stay current with journals in physiology education such as <em>Advances in Physiology Education</em> from the American Physiological Society, attend workshops, trainings, and seminars in physiology education, and seek to <strong>apply my training in enhancing the learning environment and student performance in my classroom</strong>. I take my teaching seriously and treat it as a discipline in its own right, much the same way I do my research.
      </p>

      <!-- =================== CURRENT COURSES =================== -->

      <h2 class="section-title"><span class="secondary">Current</span><span class="highlight">Courses</span></h2>
      <p>
        My teaching includes large lecture-based courses, lab instruction, and individual mentorship through undergraduate and graduate research credits.
      </p>

      <!-- ------------------- BIOL 3204 PHYSIOLOGY ------------------- -->

      <h3 class="subsection-title">
        <span class="secondary">BIOL 3204, "</span><span class="highlight">Physiology</span><span class="secondary">"</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        My primary teaching appointment is BIOL 3204, "Physiology". This is a 4-credit hour course (lecture and laboratory) that introduces students to <strong>principles of vertebrate physiological processes and their underlying anatomical, cellular, molecular features</strong>, with a primary focus on human systems. The lecture component emphasizes systems-level understanding, critical thinking, and practice-based learning through in-class iClicker questions, take-home assignments, and review opportunities. The lab is designed to reinforce lecture content with hands-on investigation and small-group collaboration. Students collect and interpret physiological data and engage in guided scientific inquiry throughout the semester.
      </p>

      <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Teaching Approach</h4>
      <p>
        My approach to teaching BIOL 3204 emphasizes clarity, structure, and <strong>support for diverse learners in a large-enrollment setting</strong>. I aim to make expectations explicit and to provide students with frequent, low-stakes opportunities to practice and receive feedback. I draw on active learning principles, including <strong>real-time polling, structured review, and reflective assignments</strong>, to help students build mastery gradually and intentionally. I also value intellectual flexibility: students can explore the material through creative or <strong>self-directed activities</strong> that suit their interests and strengths. Across both lecture and lab, I work to create a culture of transparency, empathy, and scientific curiosity.
      </p>

      <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Lecture Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Typically, multiple lecture sections (each with 150-240 students) are offered each semester. The lecture is structured as <strong>a survey of major physiological systems</strong> (i.e,, endocrine, nervous, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune). Graded activities include weekly homework assignments (10 total), daily in-class iClicker participation, midterms (4 total, lowest dropped), and a final exam. Additionally, there are extra credit opportunities to <strong>encourage students to engage in varied and reflective experiences with the material</strong>, including weekly homework activities (e.g., drawing, writing, using computer-based models and simulations, wathcing and reflecting on videos, reading and reflecting on non-fiction book chapters, etc.).

      </p>

      <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Lab Overview</h4>
      <p>
        Students select a weekly 2-hour lab section (each with typically 18-24 students) along with their lecture section. The laboratory is designed to reinforce lecture concepts through guided, hands-on activities in which <strong>students use clinically relevant analytical devices to measure their own physiological processes in real time</strong>. Students complete 12 graded lab modules throughout the semester, each requiring pre-lab assignments, in-lab participation, and engagement with physiological experiments. Graded components include attendance and participation, bi-weekly quizzes (6 total, lowest dropped), and a <strong>lab report on real physiological data collected during lab and written modeled after scientific journal articles</strong>. The lab report writing process includes a rough draft, peer review workshop, and a final submission.

      <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Student Feedback</h4>
      <p>
        I have taught over 500 students in BIOL 3204 since I joined the Department in Spring 2024. I have gotten to know some exceptionally talented students at OSU over this time, and student feedback on the course has been overwhelmingly positive. I find students tend to appreciate the structured approach of the class, the interactive nature of the lecture, and the <strong>emphasis on understanding rather than memorization</strong>. The most rewarding feedback is from students who find that the course has helped them develop thier independent and critical thinking skills and <strong>a deeper appreciation for physiology as a discipline</strong>.
