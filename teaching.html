      <!-- =================== TEACHING OVERVIEW =================== -->

      <h2 class="section-title"><span class="secondary">Teaching</span><span class="highlight">Overview</span></h2>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">I teach upper-level physiology with a focus on molecular and cellular mechanisms, and I mentor students at both the undergraduate and graduate level who conduct research in integrative physiology in my lab.</span> My approach to teaching and mentoring is based on fostering mutual respect, clearly communication of expectations, and using inclusive and active learning/mentoring practices. Whether in the classroom or the lab, my goal is to help my students and trainees build confidence, think critically, and develop enduring tools for scientific inquiry, comprehension, and achievment.
      </p>

      <!-- =================== TEACHING PHILOSOPHY =================== -->

</div>
      <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p>
        <span class="bold">I am committed to my roles as an educator and mentor, and I see both of these roles as a part of a collaborative relationship with my students and trainees.</span> In these roles, I try to foster mutual respect and a shared investment in the success of my students and trainees. To do this, I view my role more as a facilitator of learning and development, not just a source of information or grades. Importantly, I also recognize that students come from a wide range of backgrounds and bring different learning needs, so I aim to create a classroom environment that is inclusive, equitable, and actively supportive of all students.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">I want my students to engage with the complexity of biological concepts and build effective strategies for learning challenging material</span>. To support this, I focus on clear communication of expectations, consistent course structure, and low-stakes opportunities to practice key skills. I design my courses to be challenging but supportive, encouraging students to take ownership of their learning. My goal is to help them develop independence, curiosity, and a deeper understanding of both scientific content and process.
      </p>

      <!-- =================== PEDAGOGY =================== -->

      <h4 class="teaching-label">Pedagogy</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">In my courses, I use active learning strategies, structured opportunities for revision and reflection, and timely feedback to help students engage meaningfully with the learning process.</span> I support student motivation by offering assignment options, low-stakes practice, and clear expectations. These strategies create space for students to build confidence and develop mastery at their own pace. I also strive to implement a clear and consistent course structure while fostering student autonomy and growth.
      </p>

      <!-- =================== EDUCATION SCIENCE INTERESTS =================== -->

      <h4 class="teaching-label">Interests in Education Science</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">I treat teaching as a discipline in its own right and stay current with developments in education science, particularly in college-level physiology.</span> I regularly engage with journals such as <em>Advances in Physiology Education</em> (American Physiological Society), participate in workshops and training seminars, and apply evidence-based strategies in my courses. I actively seek feedback from students and colleagues and use it to refine and enhance my teaching practices, aiming to create an environment that is both effective and inspiring.

      <p>
        <span class="bold">My primary teaching appointment is BIOL 3204, "Physiology".</span> Holistically, my teaching includes large lecture-based courses, lab instruction, and individual mentorship through undergraduate and graduate research credits.

      <div class="collapsible-content">
      <p>
        <span class="bold">This is a 4-credit hour course (lecture and laboratory) that introduces students to principles of vertebrate physiological processes and their underlying anatomical, cellular, molecular features, with a primary focus on human systems.</span> The lecture component emphasizes systems-level understanding, critical thinking, and practice-based learning through in-class iClicker questions, take-home assignments, and review opportunities. The lab is designed to reinforce lecture content with hands-on investigation and small-group collaboration. Students collect and interpret physiological data and engage in guided scientific inquiry throughout the semester.
      </p>

      <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Teaching Approach</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">My approach to teaching BIOL 3204 emphasizes clarity, structure, and support for diverse learners in a large-enrollment setting.</span> I aim to make expectations explicit and to provide students with frequent, low-stakes opportunities to practice and receive feedback. I draw on active learning principles, including real-time polling, structured review, and reflective assignments, to help students build mastery gradually and intentionally. I also value intellectual flexibility: students can explore the material through creative or self-directed activities that suit their interests and strengths. Across both lecture and lab, I work to create a culture of transparency, empathy, and scientific curiosity.
      </p>

      <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Lecture Overview</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The lecture is structured as a survey of major physiological systems (i.e,, endocrine, nervous, cardiovascular, renal, gastrointestinal, reproductive, and immune).</span> Graded activities include weekly homework assignments (10 total), daily in-class iClicker participation, midterms (4 total, lowest dropped), and a final exam. Additionally, there are extra credit opportunities to encourage students to engage in varied and reflective experiences with the material, including weekly homework activities (e.g., drawing, writing, using computer-based models and simulations, wathcing and reflecting on videos, reading and reflecting on non-fiction book chapters, etc.). Typically, multiple lecture sections (each with 150-240 students) are offered each semester.

      <h4 class="teaching-label">BIOL3204 | Lab Overview</h4>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">The laboratory is designed to reinforce lecture concepts through guided, hands-on activities in which students use clinically relevant analytical devices to measure their own physiological processes in real time.</span> Students complete 12 graded lab modules throughout the semester, each requiring pre-lab assignments, in-lab participation, and engagement with physiological experiments. Graded components include attendance and participation, bi-weekly quizzes (6 total, lowest dropped), and a lab report on real physiological data collected during lab and written modeled after scientific journal articles. The lab report writing process includes a rough draft, peer review workshop, and a final submission. Students select a weekly 2-hour lab section (each with typically 18-24 students) to take along with their lecture section.

      <p>
        I have taught over 500 students in BIOL 3204 since I joined the Department in Spring 2024. <span class="bold">I have gotten to know some exceptionally talented students at OSU over this time, and student feedback on the course has been overwhelmingly positive.</span> I find students tend to appreciate the structured approach of the class, the interactive nature of the lecture, and the emphasis on understanding rather than memorization. The most rewarding feedback is from students who find that the course has helped them develop thier independent and critical thinking skills and a deeper appreciation for physiology as a discipline.
