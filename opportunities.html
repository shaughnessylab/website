        The Shaughnessy Lab welcomes motivated trainees at all stages, including undergraduate students, post-baccalaureate researchers or technicians, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, who want to contribute to any of the three thematic ares of research in the lab:
        <a href="research.html" class="bold">Comparative Physiology</a>, <a href="research.html" class="bold">Applied Physiology</a>, and <a href="research.html" class="bold">Translational Physiology</a>. 
        Prospective trainees should review our <a href="publications.html">recent papers</a> and the <a href="research.html">research page</a> that aligns with their interests.

The Shaughnessy Lab is always seeking motivated undergraduate students interested in gaining research experience in integrative physiology at the molecular, cellular, organismal, and evolutionary levels.

        <div class="collapsible-content">
          <p class="project-label">Commitment / Expectations of Research Activity</p>
          <p>
            The PI and other senior lab members often invest heavily in training students. Thus, it is expected that students to be equally committed to and engaged in research activities. Students should expect to spend 5-10 hours per week during the semester on research activities, including reading primary literature, attending lab meetings, training and working in the lab, data management, and preparing presentations. Students will be expected to work independently after initial training, and to be proactive in seeking out opportunities to learn and contribute. Undergraduate students are expected to commit at least one year to research in the lab, including two consecutive semesters. Commitments longer than one year will likely lead to students making authorship-worthy contributions to projects or to students leading their own independent projects as first author. 
          </p><p class="project-label">Research Credit / Employment</p>
          <p>
            There are four primary modes through which undergraduates conduct research in the Shaughnessy Lab: (1) for research credit, typically 1-3 credit hours of BIOL 3700 or BIOL 4700 per semester. Students interested in research credit should contact Dr. Shaughnessy to discuss projects and to be added to a course roster.; (2) as an undergraduate research fellow (see Fellowship opportunities below). All undergraduate students in the Shaughnessy Lab are strongly encouraged to apply for the undergraduate research fellowships for which they are eligible. Students interested in undergraduate research fellowships should contact Dr. Shaughnessy to discuss project fit and application timing.; (3) as a paid undergraduate research assistant through grant funding, which is dependent on availability of funds and requires a commitment of 10 hours per week during the semester. Students interested in paid positions should contact Dr. Shaughnessy to discuss project fit and funding availability.; or (4) as a volunteer undergraduate research assistant. Volunteer positions are typically reserved for students who have already completed a semester of research credit or have prior research experience.
          </p>

          <p class="project-label">How to Inquire</p>
          <p>
            Interested undergraduates should email Dr. Shaughnessy with a current CV or résumé and a brief (&lt;1 page) personal statement describing their research interests and how they align with the lab’s themes, any relevant experience, and their availability (e.g., semester(s), hours per week).</p>

The Shaughnessy Lab is always seeking motivated graduate students (either the M.S. or Ph.D.) interested in pursuing integrative physiology research as part of their graduate training. Graduate students in the Shaughnessy Lab are expected to develop independent research projects that align with the lab’s research themes.

        <div class="collapsible-content">
          <p class="project-label">Commitment / Expectations of Research Activity</p>
          <p>
            Graduate students are expected to pursue research as their primary academic and professional focus during their time in the program and to demonstrate initiative, independence, and persistence in their work. Graduate students make a full time (40-hour per week) committment to thier training, typically divided into a 20-hour employment commitment (TA or RA) and a 20-hour scholarship commitment (classes and research).Students are expected to actively participate in lab meetings, seminars, and departmental activities. Students should be prepared to dedicate significant time to developing and executing research projects, engaging in critical analysis of primary literature, mentoring undergraduate students, presenting their work at scientific meetings, and publishing their findings in peer-reviewed journals. Typical timelines for graduate students are 2–3 years for an M.S. and 4–6 years for a Ph.D. More information regarding graduate student appoints can be found through the <a href="https://cas.okstate.edu/biology/">Department of Biology</a>.

          <p class="project-label">Support / Funding</p>
          <p>
            Graduate students in the Shaughnessy Lab are typically supported as Graduate Teaching Assistants (GTAs) within the Department of Biology during the academic year (Fall and Spring terms), and as grant-funded Graduate Research Assistants (RAs) during the summer term. Year-round research assistantships are available as grant funding permits, or if a students wins external fellowships. Graduate students are strongly encouraged to apply for external fellowships such as the <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/grfp-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program">NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program (GRFP)</a>, the <a href="https://grants.nih.gov/funding/activity-codes/T32">NIH Predoctoral Individual National Research Service Award (F31)</a>, NIH Institutional Training Program (T32), or other relevant opportunities. All students receive mentorship in grant writing, professional development, and career planning.

          <p class="project-label">How to Inquire</p>
          <p>
            Prospective graduate students should email Dr. Shaughnessy with a current CV and a personal statement outlining their research interests, relevant experience, and long-term goals. Competitive applicants should demonstrate strong academic preparation in physiology, biology, or related fields, as well as enthusiasm for developing independent research projects within the research themes in the lab. Formal applications must be submitted through the <a href="https://gradcollege.okstate.edu/">Graduate College</a>. Additional information regarding graduate school admissions and appointments can be found through the <a href="https://cas.okstate.edu/biology/">Department of Biology</a>.

            Postdoctoral scholars are expected to make a full-time (40-hour per week) committment to research activities. Scholars take a leadership role in research projects, including experimental design, data collection and analysis, manuscript preparation, and presentation of results at national and international meetings. They are also expected to contribute to mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, participate actively in lab and departmental seminars, and pursue independent professional development activities. Scholars should work toward building a strong publication record and developing skills that will support their long-term career goals in academia, government, or industry.

            Postdoctoral positions in the Shaughnessy Lab are only available with grant funding or external fellowships. Prospective fellows are strongly encouraged to apply for independent postdoctoral fellowships (e.g., NSF, NIH NRSA, or society-based fellowships). The PI is committed to supporting postdoctoral scholars in the preparation of fellowship and grant applications, and in building professional networks through collaborations and conference participation.
