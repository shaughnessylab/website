We had many undergraduate poster presentations at the end of this year. Kristine and Conner both presented their posters at the 2025 OSU Undergraduate Research Symposium at the ConocoPhillips Alumni Center. They also presented thier work at the Karen L. Smith Undergraduate Symposium hosted by our Department in Life Sciences West.</p>\n<p class=\"blog-text\">Additionally, Savannah capped off her prestigious year-long Wentz Research Scholarship with a presentation at the Wentz Research Symposium in the Student Union Ballroom. Savannah graduated this semester and will be pursuing a career in wildlife conservation.</p>\n<p class=\"blog-text\">We graduate another fantastic undergraduate researcher, Mady. She was admitted to the Clinical Laboratory Sciences Program at the OSU Center for Health Sciences in Tulsa.</p>\n<p class=\"blog-text\">All of my undergraduate resaerchers have done a fantastic job this year!</p>\n<div class=\"blog-image-container\">\n<a class=\"lightbox-trigger\" data-caption=\"Kristine presenting her research at the Karen L.

She will be working on the functional evolution of receptors in the HPI axis.</p>\n<p class=\"blog-text\">Susanne was originally supposed to be joining us as an NSF RaMP Fellow and work in the lab as a full-time researcher for the next year. However, our multi-year NSF RaMP Program grant in the department was abruptly terminated. The reach of these historic cuts to science is enormous, and even our labs here in the more conservative-leaning states and public universities are being hit hard as well. The NSF RaMP Program was a highly impactful program for training the next generation of scientists, and our program has brought many jobs to Stillwater. It has been sad to see it end too early.</p>\n<p class=\"blog-text\">Luckily, we were still able to take Susanne on as a graduate student. I am thrilled to have someone in the lab working on receptor evolution! So, we will be firing back up the luciferase reporter gene assay that I used to run a lot at the University of Denver as an NSF Fellow. We are really starting to assemble lots of different tools in the lab now.</p>\n<p class=\"blog-text\"><span class=\"bold\">A Full Lab this Summer | </span>This summer, the Shaughnessy Lab has 6 people working in the lab on research assistantships, all 5 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student, Samantha Kennedy. We were able to get the whole lab (and partners/spouses) together for dinner at our house. Looking forward to a summer of productivity with this team!</p>\n<div class=\"blog-image-container\">\n<a class=\"lightbox-trigger\" data-caption=\"Lab dinner at Ciaran's house\" href=\"images/blog/lab-dinner.jpeg\">\n<img alt=\"Lab dinner at Ciaran's house.\" class=\"blog-media\" src=\"images/blog/lab-dinner.jpeg\"/>\n</a>\n<p class=\"blog-caption\">Lab dinner at Ciaran's house.</p>\n</div>\n<p class=\"blog-text\"><span class=\"bold\">NASCE | </span>Allison and I traveled to Qu\u00e9bec City for the North American Society of Comparative Endocrinologists (NASCE) meeting. It was wonderful bringing a student along to a conference. The science and socializing were fantastic, as they always are at NASCE. The poutine was... interesting, as it always is in Quebec. We brought home lots of good ideas. Of course, I brought back some maple-flavored lollipops for my toddler at home.</p>\n<div class=\"blog-image-container\">\n<a class=\"lightbox-trigger\" data-caption=\"nasce2025_flyer\" href=\"images/blog/nasce2025_flyer.jpg\">\n<img alt=\"Ciaran and Allison at NASCE\" class=\"blog-media\" src=\"images/blog/nasce2025_flyer.jpg\"/>\n</a>\n<p class=\"blog-caption\">Ciaran and Allison attended NASCE 2025 in Qu\u00e9bec City.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",

This was my first year as faculty. Tremendously busy, but not all that productive (based on the metrics I have so far been measuring my productivity). I taught a new course; I built an aquatics lab and a lab for cell culture and molecular biolgy; I have had many undergradutes working in the lab and have taken on my first PhD students; I submitted many grants that went unfunded. Still, I only published one first author publication (a book chapter) and contributed to a couple other papers (thanks to Jason Breves). This publication prodoctivity is far less than recent years... folks tell me it will be this way at the beginning of a new faculty appointment, but it is still unsatisfying. We have some exciting new papers and grants in review right now, and I am looking forward to a more productive year next year.</p>\n<div class=\"blog-video-container\">\n<a class=\"lightbox-trigger\" data-caption=\"Wetlab racks prior to arrival of fish.\" data-type=\"video\" href=\"images/blog/wetlab-racks.mp4\">\n<img alt=\"Video thumbnail\" class=\"blog-media\" src=\"images/blog/wetlab-racks.jpg\"/>\n</a>\n<p class=\"blog-caption\">Wetlab racks prior to arrival of fish.</p>\n</div>\n</div>",
